If surgical packing was placed leave it alone. The pack helps to keep the tooth exposed. If it gets dislodged or falls out do not get alarmed.<\/p>\n<h3>Bleeding<\/h3>\n<p>Some bleeding or redness in the saliva is normal for 24 hours. Excessive bleeding which results in your mouth filling rapidly with blood can frequently be controlled by biting with pressure on a gauze pad placed directly on the bleeding wound for 30 minutes. If bleeding continues please call for further instructions.<\/p>\n<h3>Swelling<\/h3>\n<p>Swelling is a normal occurrence after surgery. To minimize swelling, apply an ice bag or a plastic bag or towel filled with ice cubes on the cheek in the area of surgery. Apply the ice continuously as much as possible for the first 36 hours.<\/p>\n<h3>Diet<\/h3>\n<p>Drink plenty of fluids. Avoid hot liquids or food. Soft food and liquids should be eaten on the day of surgery. Return to a normal diet as soon as possible unless otherwise directed.<\/p>\n<h3>Pain<\/h3>\n<p>You should begin taking pain medication as soon as you feel the local anesthetic wearing off. For moderate pain, 1-2 tablets of Tylenol or Extra Strength Tylenol may be taken every 4 hours. Ibuprofen (Advil or Motrin) may be taken instead of Tylenol. Alternatively, 2-3 tablets of Ibuprofen (bought over the counter comes in 200 mg tablets) may be taken every 6 hours as needed for pain. For severe pain the prescribed medication should be taken as directed. Do not take any of the above medication if you are allergic or have been instructed by your doctor not to take it.<\/p>\n<h3>Oral Hygiene<\/h3>\n<p>Mouth cleanliness is essential to good healing. Clean your mouth thoroughly after each meal beginning the day after surgery. Brush your teeth as best you can. Rinse with warm salt water (1\/2 teaspoon of salt in a cup of warm water) six times a day. Continue this procedure until healing is complete.<\/p>\n<p><strong>REMEMBER:<\/strong> A clean wound heals better and faster.<\/p>\n<h3>Activity<\/h3>\n<p>Keep physical activities to a minimum immediately following surgery. If you are considering exercise throbbing or bleeding may occur. If this occurs you should discontinue exercising. Be aware that your normal nourishment intake is reduced. Exercise may weaken you. If you get light headed, stop exercising.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Do not disturb the wound. If surgical packing was placed leave it alone.
