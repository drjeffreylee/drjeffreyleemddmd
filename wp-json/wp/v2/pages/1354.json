My condition then was so painful; I could not open my jaw without feeling outrageous pain. It popped whenever I tried to chew. I had headaches all the time and felt so much misery. Thanks to Dr. Lee. He treated me by letting me know I had a bad condition \u2013 &#8216;TMJ&#8217; \u2013 and made a brace-guard for me. Well worth it, I wore it every day and it slowly got better. Now today, six months later, I feel no pain. Many thanks to Dr. Lee!!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\">-A.N.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\">\u201cWhen I came in I could not open my mouth very far. I also had a lot of pain. It hurt to chew and when I yawned\u2026and often when I moved my mouth. After working with Dr. Lee for 3 months to improve my TMJ disorder, I have made considerable improvement. In fact it\u2019s not really a problem anymore. I can open my mouth almost all the way. I do not have pain when eating or just moving my mouth! When I came in I thought I might need surgery. I am so glad that Dr. Lee was able to successfully help me without surgery. I am so happy.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\">-T.S.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\u201cDr. Lee was great.
