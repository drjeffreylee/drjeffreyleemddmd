Oral surgeons are dentists who have received additional, extensive\u00a0training in surgical techniques to treat malfunctions or injuries of the teeth, gums, mouth and jaws. These surgeries can treat dental problems too severe to be treated by general dentistry, such as dental implants, removing wisdom teeth, removing impacted teeth, corrective jaw surgery and bone grafts.<\/p>\n<p>Oral surgeons are skilled professionals that specialize in the surgical treatment of the defects and irregularities on the anatomy of the human jaw. Sometimes they work with the defects of the face, like cleft palate and cleft lip. Oral surgeons are usually involved in treating fractures in the supporting bone or in replanting teeth that have been displaced or knocked out. As surgical specialists, oral and maxillofacial surgeons treat facial injuries as many of the bones of the face are positioned relative to the upper and lower jaws and the associated teeth relationships. Dr. Lee maintains close communication and collaboration on a regular basis with your dentist, orthodontists, physician, and\/or restorative dentist to plan treatment.<\/p>\n<h2><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright wp-image-1074 size-medium\" title=\"shutterstock_68635222\" src=\"http:\/\/drjeffreyleemddmd.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/12\/shutterstock_68635222-650x430.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"430\" srcset=\"https:\/\/drjeffreyleemddmd.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/12\/shutterstock_68635222-650x430.jpg 650w, https:\/\/drjeffreyleemddmd.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/12\/shutterstock_68635222-450x297.jpg 450w, https:\/\/drjeffreyleemddmd.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/12\/shutterstock_68635222-1920x1271.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" \/><\/h2>\n<hr \/>\n<h3>Why a Specialist is Better<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>High Quality<\/strong>\u00a0\u00a0 An oral surgeon is generally far more able and experienced in the field of oral surgery &#8211; not just in dental implants or cosmetic dentistry, but the full range of tooth removal, gum solutions, tooth replacement and complete healing after surgery.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Economical<\/strong>\u00a0\u00a0 Seeing an oral surgeon can save you time and money. On a longterm basis, a highly trained and skilled oral surgeon will perform quality work and expose the patient to significantly minimal risk of procedure failure and thus be a far more economical choice .<\/li>\n<li><strong>Superior Training<\/strong> \u00a0 The certification of an oral &amp; maxillofacial surgeon is received by passing a rigorous test and becoming a Diplomat. Oral Surgeons are dentists with four to six years of additional specialized hospital-based surgical and anesthesia training. Oral surgeons are required to not only have completed four years of dental school but also four years of surgical residency.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<hr \/>\n<h3>First Visit<\/h3>\n<p>Your initial appointment will consist of a consultation explaining your diagnosis and treatment options. In most cases, surgery can be performed the same day as the consultation.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Please assist us by providing the following information at the time of your consultation:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your surgical referral slip and any x-rays if applicable.<\/li>\n<li>A list of medications you are presently taking.<\/li>\n<li>If you have medical or dental insurance, bring the necessary completed forms. This will save time and allow us to help you process any claims.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT:<\/strong> All patients under the age of 18 years of age must be accompanied by a parent or guardian at the consultation visit.<\/p>\n<p>It is mandatory for patients undergoing IV anesthesia for surgery to have nothing to eat or drink six hours prior to the surgery. These patients will also need an adult to drive them home.<\/p>\n<p>Please alert the office if you have a medical condition that may be of concern prior to surgery (i.e., diabetes, high blood pressure, artificial heart valves and joints, rheumatic fever, etc.) or if you are currently taking any medication (i.e., heart medications, aspirin, anticoagulant therapy, etc.).<\/p>\n<p>We ask that our patients read and follow our detailed surgical instructions found on our <a title=\"Pre-Surgery Instructions\" href=\"http:\/\/drjeffreyleemddmd.com\/pre-op-instructions\/\" class=\"broken_link\">Pre-Surgery Instructions<\/a> page prior to surgery.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h3>X-Rays<\/h3>\n<p>If your dentist or physician has taken x-rays you may request that they forward them to our office. If there is not enough time, please pick them up and bring them to our office. If additional films are necessary, panoramic x-rays can be taken at our facility.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Welcome to your first oral surgery visit.
