Avoid rinsing, spitting or touching the wound on the day of surgery. There will be a metal healing abutment protruding through the gingival (gum) tissue.<\/p>\n<h3>Bleeding<\/h3>\n<p>Some bleeding or redness in the saliva is normal for 24 hours. Excessive bleeding (your mouth fills up rapidly with blood) can be controlled by biting on a gauze pad placed directly on the\u00a0bleeding wound for 30 minutes. If bleeding continues please call for further instructions.<\/p>\n<h3>Swelling<\/h3>\n<p>Swelling is a normal occurrence after surgery. To minimize swelling, apply an ice bag, plastic bag or towel filled with ice on the cheek in the area of surgery. Apply the ice continuously as much as possible for the first 36 hours.<\/p>\n<h3>Diet<\/h3>\n<p>Drink plenty of fluids. Avoid hot liquids or food. Soft food and liquids should be eaten on the day of surgery. Return to a normal diet as soon as possible unless otherwise directed.<\/p>\n<h3>Pain<\/h3>\n<p>You should begin taking pain medication as soon as you feel the local anesthetic wearing off. For moderate pain, 1-2 tablets of Tylenol or Extra Strength Tylenol may be taken every 4 hours. Ibuprofen (Advil or Motrin) may be taken instead of Tylenol. Alternatively, 2-3 tablets of Ibuprofen (bought over the counter comes in 200 mg tablets) may be taken every 6 hours as needed for pain. For severe pain the prescribed medication should be taken as directed. Do not take any of the above medication if you are allergic or have been instructed by your doctor not to take it.<\/p>\n<h3>Antibiotics<\/h3>\n<p>Be sure to take the prescribed antibiotics as directed to help prevent infection.<\/p>\n<h3>Oral Hygiene<\/h3>\n<p>Good oral hygiene is essential to good healing. The night of surgery use the prescribed Peridex Oral Rinse before bed. The day after surgery the Peridex should be used twice daily \u2013 after breakfast and before bed. Be sure to rinse for at least 30 seconds then spit it out. Warm salt water rinses (teaspoon of salt in a cup of warm water) should be used at least 4-5 times a day as well, especially after meals. Brushing your teeth and the healing abutments is no problem. Be gentle initially with brushing the surgical areas.<\/p>\n<h3>Activity<\/h3>\n<p>Keep physical activities to a minimum immediately following surgery. If you are considering exercise, throbbing or bleeding may occur. If this occurs you should discontinue exercising. Keep in mind that you are probably not taking normal nourishment. This may weaken you and further limit your ability to exercise.<\/p>\n<h3>Wearing your Prosthesis<\/h3>\n<p>Partial dentures, flippers or full dentures should not be used immediately after dental implant surgery and for at least 10 days. This was discussed in the pre-operative consultation.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Do not disturb the wound.
