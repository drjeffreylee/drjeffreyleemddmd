Some of the types of facial trauma, which may require surgery, include facial lacerations, knocked out teeth, broken or fractures cheek, nose, jaw or eye socket. Facial trauma can also result from wartime injuries such as gunshots and blasts. Motor vehicle accidents, occupational mishaps, interpersonal violence and work accidents are all frequent causes of facial trauma. Animal attacks and work-related injuries such as industrial accidents are other causes. Facial trauma also known as maxillofacial trauma is any injury to the face or the jaw bone. Patients that sustain facial trauma may have breaks in their skin or \u201clacerations\u201d and fracture to the upper and lower jawbone and broken teeth.<\/p>\n<p>Facial trauma, or maxillofacial injury, includes any injury to the face, mouth or jaw. The most common facial trauma injuries are caused by accidents. Facial traumas include injuries to the skin, underlying skeleton, neck, nose, sinuses, eye socket, teeth and parts of the mouth. Sometimes these types of injuries are called maxillofacial injury. Facial trauma surgery should be performed immediately after the traumatic incident, however most patients will require multiple, staged surgeries.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h3>The Nature Of Maxillofacial Trauma<\/h3>\n<p>There are a number of possible causes of facial trauma such as motor vehicle accidents, accidental falls, sports injuries, interpersonal violence, and work-related injuries. Types of facial injuries can range from injuries of teeth to extremely severe injuries of the skin and bones of the face. Typically, facial injuries are classified as either soft tissue injuries (skin and gums), bone injuries (fractures) or injuries to special regions (such as the eyes, facial nerves or the salivary glands).<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h3>Soft Tissue Injuries Of The Maxillofacial Region<\/h3>\n<p>When soft tissue injuries such as lacerations occur on the face, they are repaired by suturing. In addition to the obvious concern of providing a repair that yields the best cosmetic result possible, care is taken to inspect for and treat injuries to structures such as facial nerves, salivary glands and salivary ducts (or outflow channels). Dr. Lee is a well-trained oral and maxillofacial surgeon and physician and is proficient at diagnosing and treating all types of facial lacerations.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h3>Bone Injuries Of The Maxillofacial Region<\/h3>\n<p>Fractures of the bones of the face are treated in a manner similar to the fractures in other parts of the body. The specific form of treatment is determined by various factors, which include the location of the fracture, the severity of the fracture, the age and general health of the patient. When an arm or a leg is fractured, a cast is often applied to stabilize the bone to allow for proper healing. Since a cast cannot be placed on the face, other means have been developed to stabilize facial fractures.<\/p>\n<p>One of these options involves wiring the jaws together for certain fractures of the upper and\/or lower jaw. Certain other types of fractures of the jaw are best treated and stabilized by the surgical placement of small plates and screws at the involved site. This technique of treatment can often allow for healing and obviates the necessity of having the jaws wired together. This technique is called &#8220;rigid fixation&#8221; of a fracture. The relatively recent development and use of rigid fixation has profoundly improved the recovery period for many patients, allowing them to return to normal function more quickly.<\/p>\n<p>The treatment of facial fractures should be accomplished in a thorough and predictable manner. More importantly the patient&#8217;s facial appearance should be minimally affected. An attempt at accessing the facial bones through the fewest incisions necessary is always made. At the same time the incisions that become necessary are designed to be small and whenever possible, are placed so that the resultant scar is hidden.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h3>Injuries To The Teeth &amp; Surrounding Dental Structures<\/h3>\n<p>Isolated injuries to teeth are quite common and may require the expertise of various dental specialists. Oral surgeons usually are involved in treating fractures in the supporting bone or in replanting teeth that have been displaced or knocked out. These types of injuries are treated by one of a number of forms of splinting (stabilizing by wiring or bonding teeth together). If a tooth is knocked out it should be placed in buffered solution or milk. The sooner the tooth is re-inserted into the dental socket, the better chance it will survive. Therefore, the patient should see a dentist or oral surgeon as soon as possible. Never attempt to wipe the tooth off since remnants of the ligament that hold the tooth in the jaw are attached and are vital to the success of replanting the tooth. Other dental specialists may be called upon such as endodontists, who may be asked to perform root canal therapy and\/or restorative dentists who may need to repair or rebuild fractured teeth. In the event that injured teeth cannot be saved or repaired, dental implants are often now utilized as replacements for missing teeth.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h3>Treatment<\/h3>\n<p>Facial trauma can be repaired. Injuries to the face, by their very nature, impart a high degree of emotional as well as physical trauma to patients. The science and art of treating these injuries requires special training involving a hands on experience and an understanding of how the treatment provided will influence the patient\u2019s long term function and appearance. Treatment depends on the kind of injury. Acute care involves treating loose or knocked-out teeth, suturing skin and soft tissue injuries and setting and stabilizing fractured bones.<\/p>\n<p>Doctors treat fractures of the bones of the face in a manner similar to the fractures in other parts of the body. The specific form of treatment is determined by various factors, which include the location of the fracture, the severity of the fracture, the age and general health of the patient. Dr. Lee and his staff are well-trained oral and maxillofacial surgeons and are proficient at diagnosing and treating all types of facial lacerations.<\/p>\n<p>Your surgeon performs the proper treatment of facial injuries. These professionals must be well versed in emergency care, acute treatment and long-term reconstruction and rehabilitation \u2013 not just for physical reasons but emotional as well. Oral and maxillofacial surgeons are trained, skilled and uniquely qualified to manage and treat facial trauma.
