They are friendly, capable and efficient.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAs for the treatment, the concept of a permanent implant vs. other alternatives made the decision easy. Dr. Lee is the consummate professional. Great \u2018chair-side\u2019 manners, thorough explanations, patient and not rushed. Not to mention outstanding skill.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve rarely seen such high attention to detail in a medical practice, from the important things, such as on-time appointments and proper equipment, right down to the little things you notice such as the silver ink used on the appointment cards. I always feel welcome and at home with the well-attired and efficient staff.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt was indeed a long process, about 10 months from start to finish, but given the outstanding results of my new, clean, healthy and strong teeth, I would not have it any other way.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\u2014Robert R.<\/p>\n<hr style=\"clear: both;\" \/>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-2266\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/keeley.jpg\" alt=\"Patient Testimonials the best oral surgeon\" width=\"300\" height=\"350\" \/>\u201cI was unable to bite with half my mouth after letting a root canal decay. I was recommended to go to Dr. Lee at the Orange County Dental Implant Center by my father, who is a general dentist.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\u201cThe first time I walked into Dr. Lee\u2019s office I was immediately impressed by the spa-like ambience of the office, the warm and hospitable staff and the level of care pre- and post-surgery.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\u201cDr. Lee was always comprehensive about his explanation of the treatment and he always eased the hesitations I had by answering all of my questions thoroughly. Dr. Lee is very knowledgeable, personable and very meticulous, his treatment is also very gentle.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">\u201cAfter the treatment, the staff followed up with me every week to ensure I was healing in the proper way. My overall experience has been immaculate and I\u2019ve become a lifelong patient.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\u2014Keeley H.<\/p>\n<hr style=\"clear: both;\" \/>\n<p><strong><br \/>\n<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-2267\" src=\"\/wp-content\/uploads\/mike.jpg\" alt=\"Patient Testimonials\" width=\"300\" height=\"350\" \/>\u201cAs a result of Dr. Lee\u2019s experience, I no longer have to worry about saving my teeth and, more importantly, he is saving my life.\u201d<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen I started with Dr. Lee I was recovering from radiation therapy on my jaw. As a result of the radiation, my teeth were decaying and breaking on a weekly basis.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cDr. Lee was recommended to me and he immediately began working on my treatment plan. He communicated with my oncologist, my normal dentist and even another oral surgeon that specializes in cancer. He must have put in 50 to 100 hours before I even paid any money, just to get a treatment plan.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAfter the substantial radiation to my face there was no easy solution to fix my teeth. After even more research, Dr. Lee decided he had the solution. Extractions and implants were a must, but in order to get the implants done he had to strengthen my jawbone. He put me on two months, two hours a day in an oxygen chamber to make sure the bone was fully ready. He has since completed the extractions and has begun the implants. Every bit of the treatment has been painless.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHis precision and professional skills make Dr. Lee not only the best doctor, but for me, the only doctor. His skills and expertise are like no other. Not only would I come to Dr. Lee again, I would recommend him to every person I know.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cNot only has he changed the visual appearance of my teeth, he has also changed my life.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\u2014Mike S.<\/p>\n<hr style=\"clear: both;\" \/>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\u201cMy tooth cracked on something I ate and split in half. My dentist recommended Orange County Dental Implant Center for an implant.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\u201cDr. Lee and his staff were wonderful. I\u2019m the type of person that is typically anxious when going to the dentist but my entire experience has been pleasant.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\u201cDr. Lee\u2019s experience was evident from the first consultation. From that point on, I was sure I was at the right place. He has a calm demeanor and is very professional and thorough.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\u201cI am adverse to pain and the thought of coming in was scary but Dr. Lee answered all my questions and once I was here I felt very comfortable. I got one tooth replaced with an implant and just needed local anesthesia and could drive home.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\u201cEveryone was very helpful and friendly and the office environment was clean and inviting.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\u201cI\u2019ve had no problems or issues with the procedure. I\u2019ve been extremely pleased with my smile and more confident as a result!\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\u2014 Kathleen K.<\/p>\n<hr style=\"clear: both;\" \/>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\u201cI love the services of Dr. Jeffrey Lee. Dr. He was highly recommended by my dentist, but I didn\u2019t believe that he was the greatest because I had just recently received very bad services from another dentist so it was kind of hard for me to trust someone by just a recommendation. But actually, I was wrong, I found someone out there that didn\u2019t only care about the money, I found someone who cares for the well-being of the patients. I discovered a very honest doctor, with high professionalism and with a very high work ethic.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\u201cHis experience is priceless, it only comes from years of practice. The friendliness of his staff is unrated. The atmosphere of the office made me feel like I was at home. Dr. Lee and his staff were the same, very friendly and courteous.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\u201cMaking an appointment was never a problem, they always had appointments available that best fitted my busy schedule. From the first time I called to make an appointment, to the final part of the implant process, Dr. Jeffrey Lee and his staff were very friendly, I am very satisfied with the end result. I just got my permanent tooth, it looks beautiful.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\u201cThanks a lot Dr. Jeffrey Lee and staff. I love you.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\u2014J.H.<\/p>\n<hr style=\"clear: both;\" \/>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\u201cI saw Dr. Jeffrey Lee for an implant placement which turned out to be a very smooth experience\u2014the staff were very friendly and took great care to ensure that I understood what I needed to do for the procedure and what exactly was going to be performed. During the procedure Dr. Lee remained in good communication with me. There was no pain nor any discomfort at all. There was excellent follow-up too, something which I have found to be sadly lacking with other healthcare practitioners. I would recommend Dr. Lee to anyone.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\u2014Satisfied Patient<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\">\u201cMy reception at the front desk was warm and personable.
