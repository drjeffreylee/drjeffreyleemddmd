If bleeding occurs place a gauze pad directly over the bleeding socket and apply biting pressure for 30 minutes. If bleeding continues a moist tea bag can be used for 30 minutes. If bleeding occurs avoid hot liquids and exercise and elevate the head. If bleeding persists, call our office immediately. Do not remove immediate denture unless the bleeding is severe. Expect some oozing around the side of the denture.<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Use ice packs (externally) on the same side of the face as the operated area. Apply ice for the first 36 hours only. Apply ice continuously while you are awake.<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">You should begin taking pain medication as soon as you feel the local anesthetic wearing off. For moderate pain, 1-2 tablets of Tylenol or Extra Strength Tylenol may be taken every 4 hours. Ibuprofen (Advil or Motrin) may be taken instead of Tylenol. Alternatively, 2-3 tablets of Ibuprofen (bought over the counter comes in 200 mg tablets) may be taken every 6 hours as needed for pain. Do not take any of the above medication if you are allergic or have been instructed by your doctor not to take it.<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">For severe pain use the prescription given to you. If the pain does not begin to subside in 2 days or increases after 2 days, please call our office. If an antibiotic has been prescribed, finish your prescription regardless of your symptoms.<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Drink plenty of fluids. If many teeth have been extracted, the blood lost at this time needs to be replaced. Drink at least six glasses of liquid the first day.<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Do not rinse your mouth for the first post-operative day, or while there is bleeding. After the first day, use a warm salt water rinse every 4 hours and following meals to flush out particles of food and debris that may lodge in the operated area. (One half teaspoon of salt in a glass of lukewarm water.). After you have seen your dentist for denture adjustment take out denture and rinse 3 to 4 times a day.<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Restrict your diet to liquids and soft foods which are comfortable for you to eat. As the wounds heal, you will be able to advance your diet.<\/p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The removal of many teeth at one time is quite different than the extraction of one or two teeth. Because the bone must be shaped and smoothed prior to the insertion of a denture, the following conditions may occur, all of which are considered normal:<\/p>\n<ul style=\"margin-top: 0in;\" type=\"disc\">\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\">The area operated on will swell reaching a maximum in two days. Swelling and discoloration around the eye may occur. The application of a moist warm towel will help eliminate the discoloration quicker. The towel should be applied continuously for as long as tolerable beginning 36 hours after surgery (remember ice packs are used for the first 36 hours only).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul style=\"margin-top: 0in;\" type=\"disc\">\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\">A sore throat may develop. The muscles of the throat are near the extraction sites. Swelling into the throat muscles can cause pain. This is normal and should subside in 2-3 days.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ul style=\"margin-top: 0in;\" type=\"disc\">\n<li class=\"MsoNormal\">If the corners of the mouth are stretched, they may dry out and crack. Your lips should be kept moist with an ointment like Vaseline. There may be a slight elevation of temperature for 24-48 hours. If temperature continues, notify our office.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">If immediate dentures have been inserted, sore spots may develop. In most cases, your dentist will see you within 24-48 hours after surgery and make the necessary adjustments to relieve those sore spots. Failure to do so may result in severe denture sores which may prolong the healing process.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A small amount of bleeding is to be expected after multiple tooth extractions.
