Sedation<\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>The day before surgery, drink lots of water, 8 glasses or more is best. It is important to be hydrated before surgery and before your 6 hour food and drink cut-off time.<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>All patients anticipating general anesthesia or I.V. sedation <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>must NOT have anything to eat or drink (including water) 6 hours prior to the scheduled surgery appointment<\/strong><\/span>.<\/li>\n<li>A responsible adult must drive and escort the patient home.<\/li>\n<li>The patient should not drive a vehicle or operate any machinery for 24 hours following the anesthesia experience.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>Post-Operative Instructions<\/h2>\n<h3>Bleeding<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Bite down on the gauze placed in your mouth after the procedure to help stop the bleeding.<\/li>\n<li>Change the gauze every hour until the bleeding has stopped.<\/li>\n<li>Blood in the saliva for 1-2 days is normal.<\/li>\n<li>Heavy bleeding may be controlled with gauze packs or non-herbal tea bags over the wound with biting pressure.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Pain<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Take 2-4 tablets of Advil 200mg every 6 hours or the prescribed pain medication.\u00a0 Do not take medications on an empty stomach.<\/li>\n<li>DO NOT take Tylenol with prescribed pain medication and do not take any form of aspirin.\u00a0 (Baby aspirin is OK.)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Swelling<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Swelling and bruising may increase on the second and third day after surgery.<\/li>\n<li>You may use an ice-pack to minimize the swelling.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Diet<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>You may have liquids after 1 hour and soft foods after 4 hours at room temperature or below.<\/li>\n<li>For the following 4-5 days stay on a soft diet at any temperature.<\/li>\n<li>Drink a lot of water.\u00a0 It is very important that you stay hydrated.<\/li>\n<li>It is very important to eat plenty of protein to assist in the healing process.\u00a0 Soft food recommendations: protein shakes, yogurt, cottage cheese, scrambled eggs, avocado, bananas, apple sauce, pasta, oatmeal, ice-cream, Jell-O.<\/li>\n<li>Avoid spicy, tough or sharp foods during the initial healing days.<\/li>\n<li>Do not smoke for a minimum of 72 hours and ideally 2 weeks.<\/li>\n<li>Do not drink alcohol for 24 hours.<\/li>\n<li>Do not use a straw for 2-3 days.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Oral Hygiene<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Carefully brush your teeth, but do not disturb or scrape the surgical wounds.<\/li>\n<li>On the day after, if the bleeding has stopped, gently rinse with warm salt water every 3-4 hours for 2 weeks.\u00a0 Place \u00bd-1 teaspoon of salt to 1 glass of room temperature or warm water.\u00a0 Gently swish areas and spit out.<\/li>\n<li>Do not use any commercial mouthwashes for one month.\u00a0 This may irritate the wound and slow the healing process.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>How To Use The Syringe:\u00a0 (For bottom Wisdom Teeth sockets or if recommended by the doctor)<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Start using the syringe on the third day after your surgery.\u00a0 Fill the syringe with regular water.<\/li>\n<li>Carefully put the syringe tip into the extraction socket (hole in the gums).<\/li>\n<li>Flush the area clean with the water.\u00a0 Do this a few times until the socket is fully rinsed out and is clean.<\/li>\n<li>Use after every meal and before you go to bed until the extraction socket is fully closed (1\u00bd-2 months).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Lips<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>If the corners of your mouth are cracked or sore from the retractors used during surgery, keep them well lubricated with such product as Vaseline or Chap-Stick.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Antibiotics<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>It is not always necessary to take antibiotics after oral surgery.\u00a0 If you are given a prescription other than for pain, have it filled and take all the medication according to the directions on the label.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Allergic Reaction<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>If you develop a rash or itching, stop taking your medication and call our office immediately.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Helpful Information For The Patient<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>The doctor may have stitched up the area where the surgery was performed with self-dissolving stitches.\u00a0 These stitches will dissolve by themselves over the course of time as your wound heals.<\/li>\n<li>If you experience a throbbing pain that becomes worse after a few days (generally 4-5 days after surgery) and does not respond to the medication you are taking, this may indicate dry socket.\u00a0 It is necessary for you to call the office and arrange for a sedative dressing.<\/li>\n<li>Other teeth on the same side may ache temporarily.\u00a0 You may have a sore throat or earache for a few days.\u00a0 If the medication you are taking does not make you feel comfortable, call the office.<\/li>\n<li>You may develop a fever.\u00a0 If your temperature reaches 101\u00b0, call the office.<\/li>\n<li>A numbness of the lower lip, chin or the tongue may occur on the same side as the surgery and may persist for months or longer.\u00a0 This is not unusual and usually disappears in time.\u00a0 Mention this at your post-operative visit.<\/li>\n<li>There may be a \u201chole\u201d in your gums after a surgery.\u00a0 This will fill in with bone as time progresses, and as the wound heals.\u00a0 Rinse your mouth after each meal to keep it clean.<\/li>\n<li>Bony edges or small sharp bone fragments may work up through the gums during healing.\u00a0 These are not roots.\u00a0 If annoying, call the office to arrange for their simple removal.<\/li>\n<li>The proper care following oral surgical procedures will hasten healing and prevent complications.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>For General Anesthesia\/Sedation Patients<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Try not to stand too long or walk around for the first day.\u00a0 This may cause lower blood pressure and cause dizziness, fainting, and falling.<\/li>\n<li>Do not drive for at least 24 hours after general anesthesia or sedation.<\/li>\n<li>Drowsiness, nausea and vomiting are not uncommon following intravenous anesthesia, and usually disappears after 24 hours.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>If you have any questions or concerns, please call the office at (714) 734-9363.<\/h4>\n<p><em>Get Well
