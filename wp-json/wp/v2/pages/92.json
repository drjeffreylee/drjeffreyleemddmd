Because of the nature of this specialty and the equipment used, dentists do not have the additional training and office capabilities to provide this surgery.\u00a0 That is where Dr. Lee&#8217;s office comes in.<\/p>\n<p>Oral surgery is the common solution for correcting defects or injuries in the mouth. Since it has a wide variety of purposes and can correct many different types of mouth and jaw defects, oral surgery is a reliable option for many patients. Oral surgery is commonly performed to extract wisdom teeth, for tooth transplantation, bone augmentation and also to remove cysts and tumors.<\/p>\n<p>Oral surgery is a dental specialty that focuses on the proper function of the mouth, teeth, face and jaw. Our office offers services such as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dental implants<\/li>\n<li>Wisdom tooth removal<\/li>\n<li>Jaw surgery<\/li>\n<li>Facial trauma<\/li>\n<li>TMJ disorder therapy<\/li>\n<li>Snoring therapy<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Oral surgery is commonly performed to remove wisdom teeth, prepare the mouth for dentures and\u00a0repair jaw problems. Oral surgeons may also perform more advanced procedures as required after trauma or severe disease damages the structures of the mouth. Oral surgery is a branch of dentistry which covers the treatment of bone and soft tissues of the head and neck region. It usually involves surgery to cure infections, remove unwanted growth, correct bony mal-alignment, correct jaw functions, repair bony fractures and biopsy, etc.<\/p>\n<p>Oral surgery is surgical dental treatment that is more extensive than regular dental work. Oral surgeons treat jaw related problems, repair facial injuries, provide extraction of wisdom teeth, provide tooth implants, provide dentures and treat temporomandibular joint disorder (TMJ). Oral surgery is a different kind of surgery procedure which is undertaken to correct various dental defects and is important when it is needed. Usually oral surgery is needed when the dental health conditions have reached a significant level of decay and damage. It is also needed for more routine procedures such as the removal of wisdom teeth.<\/p>\n<p>Compassion is a key component in our practice as it is our goal to treat our patients with the same level of care we would our own families. Oral surgery is an exacting discipline and each member of our staff has worked hard to obtain and maintain the education and clinical experience required for excellent outcomes.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Oral surgery is considered a specialty in the dental field and many dentists send their patients to outside specialists when they need surgery.
