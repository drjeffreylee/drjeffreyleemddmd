You may find some small granules in your mouth for the first several days. Do not be alarmed by these. It\u2019s normal to have some of them come out of the graft site and into your mouth. There are some things you could do to minimize the amount of particles that become dislodged:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do not disturb or touch the wound.<\/li>\n<li>Avoid rinsing or spitting for 2 days to allow blood clot and graft material stabilization.<\/li>\n<li>Do not apply pressure with your tongue or fingers to the grafted area, as the material is movable during the initial healing.<\/li>\n<li>Do not lift or pull on the lip to look at the sutures. This can actually cause damage to the wound site and tear the sutures.<\/li>\n<li>Do not smoke.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Following the second day, gentle rinsing would be allowed but not too vigorously as you can again disturb some of the bone graft granules. If a partial denture or a flipper was placed in your mouth, you may have to see your restorative dentist to have it adjusted and learn how to remove and replace it appropriately.<\/p>\n<p>It is our desire that your recovery be as smooth and pleasant as possible.\u00a0 Following these instructions will assist you, but if you have questions about your progress, please call the office.\u00a0 Please try to call during office hours; however a 24-hour answering service is available for after hours contact with a doctor.\u00a0 The after hours telephone number is (714) 734-9363.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The following information applies when grafting material has been placed into extraction sites to help preserve your jawbone in preparation for possible implant replacement of the extracted tooth.
