Teeth are often removed because they are impacted, that is, they cannot erupt normally on their own. Tooth extraction pain used to be a dreadful experience until some years ago, before dental anesthetics become available. In modern dentistry the pain during the extraction procedure is almost diminished, but post-operative tooth extraction pain still remains a concern. Tooth extraction healing takes only about five to seven days to be mostly complete. After seven days the healing is good enough to eat the harder foods without causing pain.<\/p>\n<p>Tooth extraction can be performed with local anesthesia if the tooth is exposed and appears to be easily removable in one piece. An instrument called an elevator is used to loosen (luxate) the tooth, widen the space in the bone, and break the tiny elastic fibers that attach the tooth to the bone. Tooth extractions can form the basis of many cosmetic dental treatments. For example, dental implant treatment typically requires tooth extraction to prepare the mouth for insertion of the implant and it is sometimes the case with orthodontic treatment that teeth need to be removed to create space.<\/p>\n<p>Tooth extraction is a process wherein a broken, damaged or decayed tooth is removed in order to prevent further complications. However, there are instances when even an undamaged molar needs to be surgically removed because it has been impacted, such as the case of a wisdom tooth.\u00a0 When facing a tooth extraction, you should prepare for post-procedure pain.\u00a0Tooth extraction is a minor surgery unless there is serious infection or disease present and normally precedes a very badly decayed or painful tooth.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Tooth extraction is performed for many reasons.
